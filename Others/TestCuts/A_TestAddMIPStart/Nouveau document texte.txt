Here are several tests on donnees4_1.dat for finding the most influential factor for the duration of MIP resolution after Preprocessing.

Conclusion:
1. The EpGap parameter has a big influence on addmipstart. Without a same EpGap as H2, addMipStart doesn't help.
2. It's very helpful to remove cuts before starting the MIP after Preprocessing.
